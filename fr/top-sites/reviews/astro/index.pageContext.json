The Swiss Ephemeris, built upon NASA's JPL DE405/406 data, provided unprecedented accuracy in planetary position calculations and quickly became the industry standard for astrological software worldwide.\n\nUnder Dr. Treindl's leadership as CEO and webmaster, Astro.com evolved into \"the first address for astrology on the web.\" The company's breakthrough came through partnerships with legendary astrologers, most notably Liz Greene, whose psychologically sophisticated interpretations set a new standard for computer-generated horoscopes. The proprietary Astro*Intelligence technology enables the software to synthesize chart factors the way professional astrologers do, recognizing inner patterns and personality structures.\n\nToday, Astrodienst maintains its headquarters in Zollikon near Zürich, operating with a dedicated team including company manager and astrologer Juri Viktor Stork and editor Karin Hoffmann. The company continues to develop its ephemeris (updated to JPL DE431 in 2014) while expanding its content library with contributions from internationally respected authors including Robert Hand, Markus Jehle, and Bernadette Brady."},"targetAudience":{"primaryUsers":["Serious astrology enthusiasts seeking psychological depth","Professional astrologers needing accurate chart calculations","Individuals at life crossroads seeking self-understanding","Couples exploring relationship dynamics","Astrological software developers","Students and researchers of astrology"],"skillLevel":"All Levels","idealFor":"Astro.com serves anyone seeking sophisticated, psychologically-informed astrology beyond superficial sun-sign readings.
