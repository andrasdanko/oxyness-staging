Here, seekers connect with hundreds of verified spiritual advisors through live text and voice channels, exploring an extensive catalogue of services: tarot spreads, astrological charts, numerological analysis, mediumistic communication, dream interpretation, and palmistry readings.\n\nThe platform operates with a selective gatekeeping philosophy, accepting fewer than one in ten applicants through a multi-stage verification process. This rigorous filtering has cultivated a practitioner base that collectively holds over 4 million five-star ratings—a sprawling archive of user testimonials. New arrivals receive three complimentary minutes with up to three different advisors, an introductory mechanism designed to facilitate compatibility assessment before financial commitment. A satisfaction guarantee accompanies first readings.\n\nPricing follows the per-minute consultation model, with rates spanning from $1.99 to $39.99 depending on advisor experience and demand. Promotional discounts ranging from 10% to 40% cycle through the platform regularly. Alongside paid services, Kasamba maintains a library of free horoscopic content and educational articles—supplementary resources for those browsing the metaphysical marketplace."},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":7.5,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":0},"reviewBody":"Among the constellation of online psychic marketplaces, Kasamba occupies the position of established elder—a platform with two decades of operational continuity and a selective practitioner vetting process accepting fewer than one in ten applicants. This stringent filtering prioritizes quality curation over quantity accumulation.\n\nThe platform excels in variety and logistical flexibility: continuous availability across twenty-four reading categories, five hundred verified advisors, and communication options spanning text and voice. The three-minute complimentary trial distributed across multiple advisors provides genuine compatibility assessment opportunity before financial commitment. Substantial free content including daily horoscopic forecasts and educational articles adds value for browsers not yet ready for paid consultation.\n\nBudget-conscious seekers should approach with economic awareness. Per-minute pricing ranging from $1.99 to $39.99 accumulates rapidly during meaningful sessions, and the mandatory credit card requirement for free trials may deter privacy-focused individuals. The entertainment disclaimer limiting platform accountability for advice accuracy represents standard industry practice—worth acknowledging even if not unique to Kasamba.\n\nFor those seeking spiritual insights with calibrated expectations, Kasamba offers a reliable, feature-rich marketplace backed by longevity and demonstrated user satisfaction metrics. The platform merits a 7.5/10 rating—strong on features and practitioner selection, moderate on value proposition and trust factors given industry-standard liability limitations.","author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Oxyness","url":"https://staging.oxyness.com/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Oxyness","url":"https://staging.oxyness.com/"},"datePublished":"2025-12-16","dateModified":"2025-12-16","inLanguage":"hu","url":"https://staging.oxyness.com/hu/top-sites/reviews/kasamba.com"}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is Kasamba and what services does it offer?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Kasamba functions as an online psychic marketplace operational since 2003, connecting seekers with over five hundred verified spiritual advisors.

Here, seekers connect with hundreds of verified spiritual advisors through live text and voice channels, exploring an extensive catalogue of services: tarot spreads, astrological charts, numerological analysis, mediumistic communication, dream interpretation, and palmistry readings.

The platform operates with a selective gatekeeping philosophy, accepting fewer than one in ten applicants through a multi-stage verification process. This rigorous filtering has cultivated a practitioner base that collectively holds over 4 million five-star ratings—a sprawling archive of user testimonials. New arrivals receive three complimentary minutes with up to three different advisors, an introductory mechanism designed to facilitate compatibility assessment before financial commitment. A satisfaction guarantee accompanies first readings.

Pricing follows the per-minute consultation model, with rates spanning from $1.99 to $39.99 depending on advisor experience and demand. Promotional discounts ranging from 10% to 40% cycle through the platform regularly. Alongside paid services, Kasamba maintains a library of free horoscopic content and educational articles—supplementary resources for those browsing the metaphysical marketplace.</p></div></section><section id="features" class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Key Features</h2><!--$?--><template id="B:0"></template><div class="animate-pulse bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 h-48 rounded-lg"></div><!--/$--></section><section id="pros-cons" class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Pros &amp;

However, the mandatory arbitration clause with class action prohibition, entertainment disclaimer, and $100 maximum liability cap warrant careful consideration—structural elements that limit platform accountability.

Trust factors include the advisor verification process accepting fewer than one in ten applicants, 4+ million accumulated ratings providing social proof, and complete corporate transparency with disclosed US, EU, and UK legal entities. The platform functions within standard industry frameworks for online psychic services, balancing operational legitimacy with legal protections limiting exposure to advice accuracy claims.</div></div></div></section><section id="history" class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">History &amp; Background</h2><div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 overflow-hidden"><div class="p-5 border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4"><div><div class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Founded</div><div class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">2003</div></div><div><div class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Founders</div><div class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Unknown</div></div><div><div class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Company</div><div class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Kasamba Inc.

While its founding narrative remains undisclosed, the platform&#x27;s operational longevity speaks to market adaptability and sustained user demand.

The corporate structure spans multiple jurisdictions: Kasamba Inc. headquartered in San Francisco serves as the U.S. entity, while adviqo GmbH (Berlin, Germany) manages European Union operations and adviqo UK Limited (Norwich) handles United Kingdom affairs. This multi-territorial architecture reflects both global reach and regulatory compliance across differing data protection and consumer protection frameworks.

Throughout its operational history, Kasamba has accumulated over 4 million five-star ratings across millions of client consultations globally. The platform evolved from early web-based chat interfaces to encompass mobile applications, voice calling infrastructure, and sophisticated algorithmic matching systems—all while maintaining its foundational marketplace model connecting spiritual seekers with independent advisors.</p></div></div></section><section id="audience" class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Who Is It For?</h2><div class="p-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="mb-6"><h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-3">Primary Users</h3><div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-2"><div class="px-3 py-2 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-center leading-tight">Adults seeking spiritual guidance and life direction</div></div><div class="px-3 py-2 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-center leading-tight">Individuals experiencing relationship uncertainty</div></div><div class="px-3 py-2 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-center leading-tight">People dealing with grief seeking medium connections</div></div><div class="px-3 py-2 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-center leading-tight">Those interested in astrology and horoscope insights</div></div></div></div><div class="mb-6 py-3 px-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><span class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Target Skill Level: </span><span class="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">All Levels</span></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6"><div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 overflow-hidden"><div class="p-5 border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Ideal For</h4></div><div class="p-6"><div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4"><div class="flex items-start gap-3"><div class="shrink-0 w-8 h-8 rounded-md flex items-center justify-center bg-green-100 dark:bg-green-900/30"><span class="text-base font-bold text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">✓</span></div><div class="flex-1"><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Relationship Guidance Seekers: An extensive love and relationship psychic category offers soulmate identification, compatibility analysis, and reconciliation guidance.

This stringent filtering prioritizes quality curation over quantity accumulation.

The platform excels in variety and logistical flexibility: continuous availability across twenty-four reading categories, five hundred verified advisors, and communication options spanning text and voice. The three-minute complimentary trial distributed across multiple advisors provides genuine compatibility assessment opportunity before financial commitment. Substantial free content including daily horoscopic forecasts and educational articles adds value for browsers not yet ready for paid consultation.

Budget-conscious seekers should approach with economic awareness. Per-minute pricing ranging from $1.99 to $39.99 accumulates rapidly during meaningful sessions, and the mandatory credit card requirement for free trials may deter privacy-focused individuals. The entertainment disclaimer limiting platform accountability for advice accuracy represents standard industry practice—worth acknowledging even if not unique to Kasamba.

For those seeking spiritual insights with calibrated expectations, Kasamba offers a reliable, feature-rich marketplace backed by longevity and demonstrated user satisfaction metrics. The platform merits a 7.5/10 rating—strong on features and practitioner selection, moderate on value proposition and trust factors given industry-standard liability limitations.</p></div></section><section class="p-6 bg-linear-to-r from-primary/10 to-secondary/10 rounded-lg border border-primary/20"><div class="text-center"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Begin Your Complimentary Reading</h2><p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 text-justify">Commence with three free minutes distributed across multiple advisors to discover your compatible psychic match.</p><a href="https://www.kasamba.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-6 py-3 bg-primary text-primary-foreground rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-primary/90 transition-colors">Visit Website →</a></div></section><div class="mt-8 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Review Updated:<!-- --> <!-- -->2025. december 16.</div></div></main><footer class="border-t bg-background"><div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"><div class="mx-auto grid max-w-5xl grid-cols-1 justify-items-center gap-4 text-center sm:grid-cols-2 sm:[&amp;&gt;*:nth-child(3)]:col-span-2 md:grid-cols-3 md:[&amp;&gt;*:nth-child(3)]:col-span-1"><a href="/hu/terms-of-service" class="text-base text-foreground/70 hover:text-foreground transition-colors">Szolgáltatási feltételek</a><a href="/hu/privacy-policy" class="text-base text-foreground/70 hover:text-foreground transition-colors">Adatvédelmi irányelvek</a><a href="/hu/cookie-policy" class="text-base text-foreground/70 hover:text-foreground transition-colors">Cookie szabályzat</a></div><div class="mt-8"><p class="text-center text-sm text-foreground/60">© 2025 Oxyness.

Here, seekers connect with hundreds of verified spiritual advisors through live text and voice channels, exploring an extensive catalogue of services: tarot spreads, astrological charts, numerological analysis, mediumistic communication, dream interpretation, and palmistry readings.\n\nThe platform operates with a selective gatekeeping philosophy, accepting fewer than one in ten applicants through a multi-stage verification process. This rigorous filtering has cultivated a practitioner base that collectively holds over 4 million five-star ratings—a sprawling archive of user testimonials. New arrivals receive three complimentary minutes with up to three different advisors, an introductory mechanism designed to facilitate compatibility assessment before financial commitment. A satisfaction guarantee accompanies first readings.\n\nPricing follows the per-minute consultation model, with rates spanning from $1.99 to $39.99 depending on advisor experience and demand. Promotional discounts ranging from 10% to 40% cycle through the platform regularly. Alongside paid services, Kasamba maintains a library of free horoscopic content and educational articles—supplementary resources for those browsing the metaphysical marketplace.","features":[{"name":"Live Chat Readings","description":"Real-time text consultations unfold within anonymous, encrypted channels where advisors and seekers exchange insights without voice or video exposure.

While its founding narrative remains undisclosed, the platform's operational longevity speaks to market adaptability and sustained user demand.\n\nThe corporate structure spans multiple jurisdictions: Kasamba Inc. headquartered in San Francisco serves as the U.S. entity, while adviqo GmbH (Berlin, Germany) manages European Union operations and adviqo UK Limited (Norwich) handles United Kingdom affairs. This multi-territorial architecture reflects both global reach and regulatory compliance across differing data protection and consumer protection frameworks.\n\nThroughout its operational history, Kasamba has accumulated over 4 million five-star ratings across millions of client consultations globally.

The three-minute complimentary trial distributed across multiple advisors provides genuine compatibility assessment opportunity before financial commitment. Substantial free content including daily horoscopic forecasts and educational articles adds value for browsers not yet ready for paid consultation.\n\nBudget-conscious seekers should approach with economic awareness.
