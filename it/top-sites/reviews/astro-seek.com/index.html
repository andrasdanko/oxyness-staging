Born on May 9, 1983, Soural combined his technical programming skills with passion for astrology to build one of the internet&#x27;s most comprehensive free astrology platforms.

The platform has grown organically through Soural&#x27;s dedication, eventually assembling an international team of astrology translators who have localized the site into nine languages. Each translator maintains expertise in astrological terminology within their language, ensuring technical accuracy across all versions.

Despite its independent origins, Astro-Seek has evolved into a sophisticated platform featuring multiple specialized subdomains for horoscopes, moon calendars, celebrity charts, numerology, and time tools. The site demonstrates the founder&#x27;s commitment to providing professional-grade astrological calculations at no cost to users worldwide.</p></div></section><section id="audience" class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Who Is It For?</h2><div class="p-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="mb-4"><h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-2">Primary Users</h3><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2"><span class="px-3 py-1 bg-primary/10 text-primary rounded-full text-sm">Astrology enthusiasts seeking free chart calculations</span><span class="px-3 py-1 bg-primary/10 text-primary rounded-full text-sm">Students learning Western and Vedic astrology</span><span class="px-3 py-1 bg-primary/10 text-primary rounded-full text-sm">Professional astrologers researching celebrity charts</span><span class="px-3 py-1 bg-primary/10 text-primary rounded-full text-sm">Individuals exploring relationship compatibility</span><span class="px-3 py-1 bg-primary/10 text-primary rounded-full text-sm">Moon phase and lunar cycle followers</span></div></div><div class="mb-4"><span class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Skill Level: </span><span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">All Levels</span></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6"><div><h4 class="font-semibold text-green-700 dark:text-green-400 mb-2 flex items-center gap-2"><span>✓</span> Ideal For</h4><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 whitespace-pre-line">Astrology Students: The platform provides educational value through its extensive celebrity database, allowing students to study chart patterns across thousands of examples while learning to interpret various house systems and aspect configurations.

The site excels for users seeking comprehensive birth chart analysis, compatibility calculations, and specialized techniques like Vedic astrology, asteroid tracking, and solar returns. Students benefit tremendously from the celebrity database&#x27;s research potential, while experienced practitioners gain reliable secondary verification tools. The nine-language support democratizes access across global audiences.

Those seeking modern, mobile-first experiences with AI-powered personalized interpretations should explore newer platforms designed for casual users. The classic interface and technical depth assume some foundational astrology knowledge, potentially overwhelming complete beginners without external guidance. The discontinued forum removes community learning opportunities that complemented the tool suite.

Overall, Astro-Seek earns an 8.5/10 rating as an Excellent platform that sets the standard for free astrology resources. Its unmatched feature-to-price ratio, calculation accuracy, and customization options make it a must-bookmark site for anyone serious about astrological study. The dated design and generic interpretations represent minor trade-offs against the extraordinary value delivered at zero cost.</p></div></section><section class="p-6 bg-linear-to-r from-primary/10 to-secondary/10 rounded-lg border border-primary/20"><div class="text-center"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Calculate Your Birth Chart</h2><p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">Discover your planetary placements, house positions, and natal aspects with Astro-Seek&#x27;s comprehensive free birth chart calculator.</p><a href="https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/birth-chart-horoscope-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-6 py-3 bg-primary text-primary-foreground rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-primary/90 transition-colors">Visit Website →</a></div></section><div class="mt-8 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Review Updated:<!-- --> <!-- -->15 dicembre 2025</div></div></main><footer class="border-t bg-background"><div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-8 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"><div class="mx-auto grid max-w-5xl grid-cols-1 justify-items-center gap-4 text-center sm:grid-cols-2 sm:[&amp;&gt;*:nth-child(3)]:col-span-2 md:grid-cols-3 md:[&amp;&gt;*:nth-child(3)]:col-span-1"><a href="/it/terms-of-service" class="text-base text-foreground/70 hover:text-foreground transition-colors">Termini di servizio</a><a href="/it/privacy-policy" class="text-base text-foreground/70 hover:text-foreground transition-colors">Informativa sulla privacy</a><a href="/it/cookie-policy" class="text-base text-foreground/70 hover:text-foreground transition-colors">Politica sui cookie</a></div><div class="mt-8"><p class="text-center text-sm text-foreground/60">© 2025 Oxyness.
