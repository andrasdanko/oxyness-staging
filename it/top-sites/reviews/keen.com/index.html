Over 50 million conversations have passed through Keen's channels across 25 years.\n\nThe platform serves newcomers and long-term seekers alike. Dual introductory offers (3 free minutes OR 5 minutes for $1.99) function as genuine low-risk invitations for first-time users."},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":7.8,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":0},"reviewBody":"Keen occupies a peculiar position in the digital spiritual landscape: neither boutique nor impersonal, it functions as a veteran marketplace that has survived long enough to develop genuine institutional knowledge. The platform offers substantive value through its extensive advisor network, transparent review infrastructure, and communication flexibility that respects different user preferences.\n\nSeekers navigating relationship turbulence, spiritual exploration, or grief will find Keen's 2,000+ advisors equipped to address diverse needs across the spectrum of metaphysical practices. The dual introductory offers (3 free minutes OR 5 minutes for $1.99) represent genuine low-risk trials rather than manipulative bait, while the Best Match quiz and 10+ million customer reviews minimize the research burden for first-time users. The free horoscope and article content provides ongoing value independent of paid consultations.\n\nHowever, budget-conscious seekers should approach with awareness that extended readings accumulate costs rapidly—emotional vulnerability and time awareness rarely coexist, making runaway sessions a real risk. Users preferring video consultations or requiring non-English services must seek alternative platforms. The entertainment disclaimer, while legally standard, will concern those wanting spiritual guidance positioned as something more authoritative than personal perspective.\n\nAt 7.8/10, Keen earns a \"Very Good\" rating for delivering reliable, accessible psychic services backed by strong trust indicators and operational longevity. The platform's quarter-century survival and massive conversation volume provide confidence that users will locate suitable advisors, though individual reading quality remains heavily dependent on advisor selection and personal compatibility.\n\nWhat lingers after examining Keen is less a sense of mystical revelation and more an appreciation for infrastructural competence—the platform has built systems that work, maintained them across turbulent decades, and resisted the temptation to overpromise. That kind of institutional steadiness holds its own value in the often-chaotic spiritual services industry.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Astra Lyrienne, Esoteric knowledge guide","jobTitle":"Esoteric Knowledge Guide"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Oxyness","url":"https://staging.oxyness.com/"},"datePublished":"2025-12-16","dateModified":"2025-12-16","inLanguage":"it","url":"https://staging.oxyness.com/it/top-sites/reviews/keen.com"}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is Keen and what services does it offer?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Keen is an online psychic marketplace operating since 1999, connecting users with over 2,000 spiritual advisors.

This structural simplicity carries both virtue and risk: you pay only for time consumed, but that time can accumulate with alarming speed during emotionally vulnerable consultations when clock-watching feels inappropriate.

The dual introductory offers (3 free minutes OR 5 minutes for $1.99) provide genuine low-risk entry points rather than manipulative bait. With rates spanning $1.99 to $30/minute (averaging approximately $3.50), cost forecasting requires awareness of your chosen advisor&#x27;s positioning on that spectrum.

The four-tier Keen Rewards program transforms loyalty into tangible value—Transcend members earn double points, and frequent users can accumulate meaningful credits. The $20 referral bonus adds another offset mechanism. The $25 satisfaction guarantee provides limited recourse, though it issues account credit rather than cash refunds.

Payment flexibility is strong: Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, PayPal, and prepaid cards all accepted. For occasional seekers monitoring session length, the economics work. For those prone to extended conversations about matters of the heart, budget discipline becomes essential self-protection.</p></div></div></section><section id="content" class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Content Quality</h2><div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 overflow-hidden"><div class="p-5 border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="flex items-center gap-4"><div class="flex items-baseline"><span class="text-4xl font-bold text-primary">8</span><span class="text-xl text-gray-400 ml-1">/10</span></div><div class="border-l border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pl-4"><div class="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Content Quality Rating</div><div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Writing, Depth &amp; Freshness</div></div></div></div><div class="p-6"><div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3 mb-6"><div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 uppercase tracking-wide mb-2">Writing Quality</div><div class="flex items-center gap-2"><span class="inline-block px-2 py-1 rounded text-xs font-medium bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 dark:bg-blue-900/30 dark:text-blue-300">Good</span><span class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Professional</span></div></div><div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 uppercase tracking-wide mb-2">Content Depth</div><div class="text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Moderate</div></div><div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 uppercase tracking-wide mb-2">Freshness</div><div class="text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Recent<!-- --> — <!-- -->Active</div></div><div class="p-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 uppercase tracking-wide mb-2">Multimedia</div><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2"><span class="px-2.5 py-1 rounded-md text-xs font-medium bg-green-100 text-green-700 dark:bg-green-900/30 dark:text-green-400">✓<!-- --> Images</span><span class="px-2.5 py-1 rounded-md text-xs font-medium bg-gray-100 text-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">✕<!-- --> Videos</span><span class="px-2.5 py-1 rounded-md text-xs font-medium bg-green-100 text-green-700 dark:bg-green-900/30 dark:text-green-400">✓<!-- --> Interactive</span></div></div></div><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">Article content balances accessibility with substance.

The transparent advisor rating system—built on decades of accumulated customer feedback—provides genuine consumer protection rather than curated testimonials. The satisfaction guarantee ($25 credit within 72 hours) and TRUSTe privacy certification add additional trust layers.

The BBB listing shows 26 closed complaints over 3 years (6 in the past 12 months) with &quot;Not Rated&quot; status, indicating the company falls outside BBB&#x27;s evaluation scope rather than failing evaluation criteria. The complaint volume, while non-zero, remains modest relative to the platform&#x27;s massive scale.

The &#x27;entertainment purposes only&#x27; disclaimer is legally standard across the psychic services industry, functioning as liability protection rather than admission of fraudulent intent. Seekers should understand they are purchasing guidance and perspective, not guaranteed outcomes or professional counseling.</div></div></div></section><section id="history" class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">History &amp; Background</h2><div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 overflow-hidden"><div class="p-5 border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700"><div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4"><div><div class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Founded</div><div class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">1999</div></div><div><div class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Founders</div><div class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Karl Jacob</div></div><div><div class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Company</div><div class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Ingenio, LLC</div></div><div><div class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Headquarters</div><div class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">San Francisco, California, USA</div></div></div></div><div class="p-6"><p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line text-justify">Keen emerged in 1999 during the dot-com boom&#x27;s most exuberant phase, founded by Karl Jacob in San Francisco as a &quot;Live Answer Community&quot;—a fee-based platform connecting users with experts via phone consultations. The timing proved fortuitous: major investors including eBay, Microsoft, The Carlyle Group, and Benchmark Capital poured $60 million into the venture in 2000, with total funding reaching $109 million by year&#x27;s end. It became the fastest-growing e-commerce company of that era—a distinction both impressive and ominous given how many such companies vanished within years.

Corporate drama arrived in 2002 when founder Karl Jacob was ousted by the board. The company was renamed Ingenio and subsequently merged with LiveAdvice and Inforocket, with Keen.com evolving into a specialized brand focused on psychic services. AT&amp;T acquired Ingenio in 2007, and Alpine Investors purchased it in 2013, beginning a period of aggressive expansion.

From 2015-2023, Ingenio grew through acquisitions of meditation apps and marketplace brands across Europe and North America. Today, the parent company operates 20+ global brands across 6 languages from its headquarters at 182 Howard Street #826, San Francisco, with Laura Walsh serving as CEO. The platform has facilitated over 50 million conversations, accumulated over 10 million customer reviews, and maintains 1,600+ vetted advisors who undergo identity verification and screening.

What began as a venture-capital darling of the dot-com era has transformed into something rarer: a survivor, quietly building infrastructure while flashier competitors came and went.</p></div></div></section><section id="audience" class="mb-8"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Who Is It For?</h2><div class="p-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-200

text-justify">Keen occupies a peculiar position in the digital spiritual landscape: neither boutique nor impersonal, it functions as a veteran marketplace that has survived long enough to develop genuine institutional knowledge. The platform offers substantive value through its extensive advisor network, transparent review infrastructure, and communication flexibility that respects different user preferences.

Seekers navigating relationship turbulence, spiritual exploration, or grief will find Keen&#x27;s 2,000+ advisors equipped to address diverse needs across the spectrum of metaphysical practices. The dual introductory offers (3 free minutes OR 5 minutes for $1.99) represent genuine low-risk trials rather than manipulative bait, while the Best Match quiz and 10+ million customer reviews minimize the research burden for first-time users. The free horoscope and article content provides ongoing value independent of paid consultations.

However, budget-conscious seekers should approach with awareness that extended readings accumulate costs rapidly—emotional vulnerability and time awareness rarely coexist, making runaway sessions a real risk. Users preferring video consultations or requiring non-English services must seek alternative platforms. The entertainment disclaimer, while legally standard, will concern those wanting spiritual guidance positioned as something more authoritative than personal perspective.

At 7.8/10, Keen earns a &quot;Very Good&quot; rating for delivering reliable, accessible psychic services backed by strong trust indicators and operational longevity. The platform&#x27;s quarter-century survival and massive conversation volume provide confidence that users will locate suitable advisors, though individual reading quality remains heavily dependent on advisor selection and personal compatibility.

What lingers after examining Keen is less a sense of mystical revelation and more an appreciation for infrastructural competence—the platform has built systems that work, maintained them across turbulent decades, and resisted the temptation to overpromise. That kind of institutional steadiness holds its own value in the often-chaotic spiritual services industry.</p></div></section><section class="p-6 bg-linear-to-r from-primary/10 to-secondary/10

This structural simplicity carries both virtue and risk: you pay only for time consumed, but that time can accumulate with alarming speed during emotionally vulnerable consultations when clock-watching feels inappropriate.\n\nThe dual introductory offers (3 free minutes OR 5 minutes for $1.99) provide genuine low-risk entry points rather than manipulative bait. With rates spanning $1.99 to $30\\/minute (averaging approximately $3.50), cost forecasting requires awareness of your chosen advisor's positioning on that spectrum.\n\nThe four-tier Keen Rewards program transforms loyalty into tangible value—Transcend members earn double points, and frequent users can accumulate meaningful credits. The $20 referral bonus adds another offset mechanism. The $25 satisfaction guarantee provides limited recourse, though it issues account credit rather than cash refunds.\n\nPayment flexibility is strong: Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, PayPal, and prepaid cards all accepted. For occasional seekers monitoring session length, the economics work. For those prone to extended conversations about matters of the heart, budget discipline becomes essential self-protection."},"history":{"founded":"1999","founders":"Karl Jacob","company":"Ingenio, LLC","headquarters":"San Francisco, California, USA","story":"Keen emerged in 1999 during the dot-com boom's most exuberant phase, founded by Karl Jacob in San Francisco as a \"Live Answer Community\"—a fee-based platform connecting users with experts via phone consultations. The timing proved fortuitous: major investors including eBay, Microsoft, The Carlyle Group, and Benchmark Capital poured $60 million into the venture in 2000, with total funding reaching $109 million by year's end. It became the fastest-growing e-commerce company of that era—a distinction both impressive and ominous given how many such companies vanished within years.\n\nCorporate drama arrived in 2002 when founder Karl Jacob was ousted by the board. The company was renamed Ingenio and subsequently merged with LiveAdvice and Inforocket, with Keen.com evolving into a specialized brand focused on psychic services. AT&T acquired Ingenio in 2007, and Alpine Investors purchased it in 2013, beginning a period of aggressive expansion.\n\nFrom 2015-2023, Ingenio grew through acquisitions of meditation apps and marketplace brands across Europe and North America. Today, the parent company operates 20+ global brands across 6 languages from its headquarters at 182 Howard Street #826, San Francisco, with Laura Walsh serving as CEO. The platform has facilitated over 50 million conversations, accumulated over 10 million customer reviews, and maintains 1,600+ vetted advisors who undergo identity verification and screening.\n\nWhat began as a venture-capital darling of the dot-com era has transformed into something rarer: a survivor, quietly building infrastructure while flashier competitors came and went."},"targetAudience":{"primaryUsers":["Individuals seeking relationship and love guidance","People exploring spiritual practices and metaphysical topics","Those grieving who want to connect with deceased loved ones","Users seeking career and financial direction","Astrology and tarot enthusiasts wanting personalized readings"],"skillLevel":"All Levels","idealFor":"Relationship Seekers: The largest advisor category concentrates on love and relationships, with 266+ specialists addressing the messy terrain of breakups, soulmate questions, and commitment anxieties—the platform clearly understands where much of human suffering concentrates.\n\nSpiritual Curious Beginners: The introductory offer, Best Match quiz, and extensive free content create a gentle on-ramp for newcomers who find spiritual services intimidating or unfamiliar—lowering barriers without pressuring commitment.\n\nPrivacy-Conscious Users: Anonymous transactions and confidential conversations address the reality that many spiritual inquiries involve topics people cannot discuss with friends, family, or therapists—the digital veil provides essential psychological safety.\n\nBusy Professionals: 24\\/7 availability and multiple communication channels accommodate demanding schedules that make traditional appointment-based spiritual practices impractical—access replaces ritual scheduling.\n\nLoyal Repeat Customers: The Keen Rewards program and ability to build ongoing relationships with familiar advisors benefit users seeking sustained spiritual guidance rather than one-off consultations.","notIdealFor":"Budget-Constrained Users: Extended readings at $5-15 per minute accumulate costs with alarming speed—a 30-minute session can easily reach $150-450, placing regular consultations out of reach for many seekers.\n\nVideo Communication Preference: Users for whom face-to-face visual connection is essential must seek alternative platforms; Keen's phone-and-text-only infrastructure omits this entirely.\n\nEvidence-Based Seekers: The 'entertainment purposes only' disclaimer and absence of scientific validation frameworks will disappoint those seeking verifiable, evidence-based guidance rather than intuitive counsel.\n\nNon-English Speakers: The platform operates exclusively in English with no multilingual support or translated content, limiting accessibility for the global spiritual community."},"userExperience":{"navigation":{"quality":"Good","notes":"Clear category hierarchy with multiple pathways to advisors.

The complaint volume, while non-zero, remains modest relative to the platform's massive scale.\n\nThe 'entertainment purposes only' disclaimer is legally standard across the psychic services industry, functioning as liability protection rather than admission of fraudulent intent. Seekers should understand they are purchasing guidance and perspective, not guaranteed outcomes or professional counseling."},"ratings":{"overall":7.8,"breakdown":{"contentQuality":7.5,"designUx":8,"features":8.5,"valueForMoney":7,"trustCredibility":8,"mobileExperience":8},"verdict":"Very Good"},"faq":[{"question":"What is Keen and what services does it offer?","answer":"Keen is an online psychic marketplace operating since 1999, connecting users with over 2,000 spiritual advisors.

The platform offers substantive value through its extensive advisor network, transparent review infrastructure, and communication flexibility that respects different user preferences.\n\nSeekers navigating relationship turbulence, spiritual exploration, or grief will find Keen's 2,000+ advisors equipped to address diverse needs across the spectrum of metaphysical practices. The dual introductory offers (3 free minutes OR 5 minutes for $1.99) represent genuine low-risk trials rather than manipulative bait, while the Best Match quiz and 10+ million customer reviews minimize the research burden for first-time users. The free horoscope and article content provides ongoing value independent of paid consultations.\n\nHowever, budget-conscious seekers should approach with awareness that extended readings accumulate costs rapidly—emotional vulnerability and time awareness rarely coexist, making runaway sessions a real risk. Users preferring video consultations or requiring non-English services must seek alternative platforms. The entertainment disclaimer, while legally standard, will concern those wanting spiritual guidance positioned as something more authoritative than personal perspective.\n\nAt 7.8\\/10, Keen earns a \"Very Good\" rating for delivering reliable, accessible psychic services backed by strong trust indicators and operational longevity. The platform's quarter-century survival and massive conversation volume provide confidence that users will locate suitable advisors, though individual reading quality remains heavily dependent on advisor selection and personal compatibility.\n\nWhat lingers after examining Keen is less a sense of mystical revelation and more an appreciation for infrastructural competence—the platform has built systems that work, maintained them across turbulent decades, and resisted the temptation to overpromise. That kind of institutional steadiness holds its own value in the often-chaotic spiritual services industry."},"callToAction":{"primaryCta":"Get 5 Minutes for $1","ctaUrl":"https:\\/\\/www.keen.com","ctaDescription":"Try Keen's psychic advisors with a low-risk introductory offer and discover spiritual guidance tailored to your needs."},"reviewDate":"2025-12-16","modifiedDate":"2025-12-16","analyzedBy":"Astra Lyrienne, Esoteric knowledge guide"},"alternatives":[{"slug":"kasamba.com","title":"Kasamba.com Review 2025: Psychic Reading Platform","url":"https:\\/\\/www.kasamba.com","category":"Psychic Services","subcategory":"Online Psychic Reading Marketplace","rating":7.5,"previewImage":"reviews\\/kasamba-com\\/desktop"},{"slug":"astro.com","title":"Astro.com Review 2025: Birth Charts & Analysis","url":"https:\\/\\/www.astro.com","category":"Astrology","subcategory":"Horoscopes & Birth Charts","rating":8.7,"previewImage":"reviews\\/astro-com\\/desktop"},{"slug":"astro-seek.com","title":"Astro-Seek.com Review 2025: Free Astrology Tools","url":"https:\\/\\/www.astro-seek.com","category":"Astrology","subcategory":"Birth Chart Calculators","rating":8.5,"previewImage":"reviews\\/astro-seek-com\\/desktop"},{"slug":"astrology.com","title":"Astrology.com Review 2025: Free Horoscopes & Tarot","url":"https:\\/\\/www.astrology.com","category":"Astrology","subcategory":"Horoscopes & Spiritual Guidance","rating":8.2,"previewImage":"reviews\\/astrology-com\\/desktop"},{"slug":"horoscope.com","title":"Horoscope.com Review 2025: Free Astrology & Tarot","url":"https:\\/\\/www.horoscope.com","category":"Astrology & Divination","subcategory":"Horoscopes, Tarot, Natal Chart Tools","rating":8.2,"previewImage":"reviews\\/horoscope-com\\/desktop"},{"slug":"astrosage.com","title":"AstroSage.com Review 2025: Free Vedic Astrology","url":"https:\\/\\/www.astrosage.com","category":"Astrology","subcategory":"Vedic Astrology & Horoscopes","rating":8,"previewImage":"reviews\\/astrosage-com\\/desktop"},{"slug":"astroyogi.com","title":"Astroyogi.com Review 2025: 5,000+ Astrologers","url":"https:\\/\\/www.astroyogi.com","category":"Astrology","subcategory":"Online Astrology Consultation Platform","rating":8,"previewImage":"reviews\\/astroyogi-com\\/desktop"},{"slug":"astrotalk.com","title":"Astrotalk.com Review 2025: Vedic Astrology","url":"https:\\/\\/astrotalk.com","category":"Astrology","subcategory":"Online Consultation Platform","rating":7.8,"previewImage":"reviews\\/astrotalk-com\\/desktop"}]}}</script>
