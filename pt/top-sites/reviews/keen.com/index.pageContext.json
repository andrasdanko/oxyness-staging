Major early investors included eBay, Microsoft, The Carlyle Group, and Benchmark Capital, with $60 million raised in 2000 and total funding reaching $109 million by year's end—making it the fastest-growing e-commerce company at the time.\n\nIn 2002, Karl Jacob was ousted by the board, and the company was renamed Ingenio. It subsequently merged with LiveAdvice and Inforocket. Keen.com evolved into a brand focused specifically on psychic services. AT&T acquired Ingenio in 2007, and Alpine Investors purchased the company in 2013. From 2015-2023, Ingenio expanded through acquisitions of meditation apps and marketplace brands across Europe and North America.\n\nToday, Ingenio operates 20+ global brands across 6 languages, headquartered at 182 Howard Street #826, San Francisco. Current CEO is Laura Walsh. The platform has facilitated over 50 million conversations with over 10 million customer reviews, maintaining 1,600+ vetted advisors who undergo identity verification and screening processes."},"targetAudience":{"primaryUsers":["Individuals seeking relationship and love guidance","People exploring spiritual practices and metaphysical topics","Those grieving who want to connect with deceased loved ones","Users seeking career and financial direction","Astrology and tarot enthusiasts wanting personalized readings"],"skillLevel":"All Levels","idealFor":"Relationship Seekers: The largest advisor category focuses on love and relationships, with 266+ specialists addressing breakups, soulmate questions, and commitment issues.\n\nSpiritual Curious Beginners: The introductory offer, Best Match quiz, and extensive free content lower barriers for newcomers exploring psychic services.\n\nPrivacy-Conscious Users: Anonymous transactions and confidential conversations appeal to those discussing sensitive personal matters.\n\nBusy Professionals: 24/7 availability and multiple communication channels accommodate demanding schedules without appointment constraints.\n\nLoyal Repeat Customers: Keen Rewards program and familiar advisors benefit users seeking ongoing spiritual guidance relationships.","notIdealFor":"Budget-Constrained Users: Extended readings at $5-15 per minute accumulate quickly; those seeking lengthy consultations may find costs prohibitive.\n\nVideo Communication Preference: Users wanting face-to-face video readings must look elsewhere as Keen only offers phone and text chat.\n\nEvidence-Based Seekers: The 'entertainment purposes only' disclaimer and lack of scientific validation may disappoint those seeking verifiable guidance.\n\nNon-English Speakers: Platform operates exclusively in English with no multilingual support or translated content."},"userExperience":{"navigation":{"quality":"Good","notes":"Clear category hierarchy with multiple pathways to advisors.
