The platform provides daily, weekly, and yearly horoscopes for all twelve zodiac signs, complemented by specialized readings for love, career, and dating.\n\nBeyond horoscopes, the site features a robust free birth chart calculator, comprehensive tarot card interpretations covering all 78 cards plus over 6,000 two-card combinations, and detailed educational content spanning Western astrology, Chinese zodiac, and numerology. The platform also connects users with live psychic advisors through its partnership with Keen.com.\n\nOperated by Horoscope.com, Inc. from San Francisco, the site balances substantial free content with premium reports ranging from $9.95 to $31.99. Its award-winning design and eight-year content archive make it an authoritative resource for beginners seeking accessible guidance and enthusiasts wanting deeper astrological insights."},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":8.2,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":0},"reviewBody":"Astrology.com earns its position as a leading astrology platform through the sheer breadth and quality of its free content. The combination of daily horoscopes for all signs, an exceptional tarot reference library, free birth chart calculations, and comprehensive educational resources provides tremendous value without cost. The award-winning design makes navigation intuitive even across thousands of pages.\n\nThis platform is ideal for astrology enthusiasts who want reliable daily horoscopes, beginners learning about zodiac signs and tarot cards, and couples curious about compatibility. The eight-year content archive and professional astrologer authorship ensure quality interpretations. Users exploring multiple divination systems will appreciate the integrated coverage of Western astrology, Chinese zodiac, tarot, and numerology.\n\nUsers seeking advanced professional tools, non-English content, or dedicated mobile apps should look elsewhere. Professional astrologers may find the interpretations too generalized for their client work, and the English-only limitation excludes non-English speakers. The help center access issues observed during testing suggest potential customer support limitations.\n\nWith an overall score of 8.2/10, Astrology.com represents an excellent free resource that rivals many paid competitors. The freemium model strikes an effective balance, offering substantial value at no cost while providing deeper premium reports for those wanting personalized professional analysis. For anyone interested in astrology, horoscopes, or tarot, this site deserves a prominent bookmark.","author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Oxyness","url":"https://staging.oxyness.com/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Oxyness","url":"https://staging.oxyness.com/"},"datePublished":"2025-12-15","dateModified":"2025-12-15","inLanguage":"en","url":"https://staging.oxyness.com/top-sites/reviews/astrology.com"}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is Astrology.com and what does it offer?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Astrology.com is a comprehensive astrology platform offering free daily horoscopes for all 12 zodiac signs, interactive tarot readings, birth chart calculations, compatibility tools, and extensive educational content.

The combination of daily horoscopes for all signs, an exceptional tarot reference library, free birth chart calculations, and comprehensive educational resources provides tremendous value without cost. The award-winning design makes navigation intuitive even across thousands of pages.

This platform is ideal for astrology enthusiasts who want reliable daily horoscopes, beginners learning about zodiac signs and tarot cards, and couples curious about compatibility. The eight-year content archive and professional astrologer authorship ensure quality interpretations. Users exploring multiple divination systems will appreciate the integrated coverage of Western astrology, Chinese zodiac, tarot, and numerology.

Users seeking advanced professional tools, non-English content, or dedicated mobile apps should look elsewhere. Professional astrologers may find the interpretations too generalized for their client work, and the English-only limitation excludes non-English speakers. The help center access issues observed during testing suggest potential customer support limitations.

With an overall score of 8.2/10, Astrology.com represents an excellent free resource that rivals many paid competitors. The freemium model strikes an effective balance, offering substantial value at no cost while providing deeper premium reports for those wanting personalized professional analysis.
